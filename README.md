## JavaScript Playground

#### Motivation

I recently completed a project in React and found myself extremely pleased with the reactive nature of React. I also found React wraps quite of a bit of functionality into simple wrappers. My aim with this repo is to recreate some of that functionality with plain JavaScript to get a better sense of some key fundamentals. I'll also be exploring some other patterns that aren't strictly related to React.

#### Features
- Dom element factory

#### Installation

Clone the repo and then install dependencies

```
npm install
```

Build and launch

```
npm start
```
